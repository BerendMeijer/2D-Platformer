This is a very simple side-scroller; you can hit the spacebar or press the Y button to make the character jump.

Decisions I've made to improve gamefeel:
- Applying extra gravity to the character, because it makes movement feel snappier.
- Based the speed of the walking animation on the velocity of the player, so the character movement feels realistic.
- Rotating the character on jump, to provide an extra sense of the direction the character is moving in.
- Giving audio feedback on jump, because it feels like an extra reward for pressing the jump button.
- Allowing players to hold the space bar, for automatic continuous jumping. 
  It's fun to see the character bouncing through the level.
- Made colliders in the level as smooth as possible to avoid getting stuck by any edges.
- Added some background music because the world didn't feel very immersive without it.
- Added a camera script that follows the player smoothly, because it doesn't feel nice if the camera is stuck to the player.

Time spent on the assignment: 9-10 hours.

If I had more time, I would have:
- Added some visual effect for jumping as well, like some dust particles on the ground.
- Added footstep sounds.
- Added exploding confetti on reaching the end of the level.
- Let hitting spikes make you restart.
- Let falling under the level make you restart.
